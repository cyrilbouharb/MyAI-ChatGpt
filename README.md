# MyAI-ChatGpt

Welcome to my comprehensive AI chatbot project, a scalable and secure clone of ChatGPT built with the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React, and Node.js) enhanced by TypeScript. This project serves as a deep dive into creating advanced, secure, and production-ready SaaS applications using modern web technologies.

## Project Overview

I developed this project to demonstrate the integration of cutting-edge technologies in building effective and interactive AI-driven applications. It encapsulates the practical implementation of theoretical knowledge into a functional AI chatbot.

## Key Features

- **MERN Stack Implementation**: Implemented a full-stack application using MongoDB, Express, React, and Node.js.
- **Advanced Authentication System**: Developed a custom authentication system utilizing JWT tokens and HTTP-only cookies for secure user authentication and authorization.
- **Data Validation**: Integrated express-validator middleware for robust validation of backend data.
- **Database Usage**: Configured MongoDB to store user chats and session data efficiently.
- **Secure Routing**: Ensured the security of routes with comprehensive verification checks.
- **React Frontend**: Built a modern React application using Vite, optimizing developer experience and application performance.
- **Responsive and Attractive UI**: Created a responsive and user-friendly chat UI with the Material-UI library.
- **OpenAI Integration**: Utilized OpenAI's API to power the conversational capabilities of the chatbot, akin to functionalities seen in ChatGPT.
- **Session Management**: Managed user sessions to maintain state and user data across different interactions.

## Prerequisites

Before you start, make sure you have the following installed on your system:
- Node.js
- npm (Node Package Manager)
- MongoDB
- Git

## Installation

To set up the project locally, follow these steps:

Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-repository-url.git
cd ai-chatgpt-mern
```

### Backend Setup

Navigate to the backend directory, install dependencies, and start the server:

```bash
cd backend
npm install
npm run dev
```

This will launch the backend server on [http://localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000).

### Frontend Setup

In a new terminal window, go to the frontend directory, install dependencies, and start the server:

```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```

The frontend will be accessible at [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173).

## Usage

With both servers running, open your browser and go to the frontend URL to interact with the AI chatbot. You can register, log in, and engage in conversations immediately.
